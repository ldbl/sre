# terraform-validate.sh - pre-commit hook terraform-validate (runs when a .tf or .tfvars file is
# staged); `make validate` and the Pre-commit CI job run it too.
#
# Validate every Terraform module the course uses: the local kind cluster
# (core track), the Hetzner cluster (cloud track) and the state lab.
# Usage: scripts/terraform-validate.sh   (from the repository root). Needs terraform; changes no
# state and no cluster.
#
# Each module is initialised in its own throw-away TF_DATA_DIR with
# -backend=false: validate needs the providers and modules, never the state.
# The module's real .terraform/ is not touched, so a directory that was once
# initialised against a remote backend (R2) does not make validate read that
# backend - or fail on whatever cloud credentials happen to be in the shell.
# The trap removes the current module's data dir also when init or validate
# fails (set -e exits before the rm below); each dir holds the providers.
#
# Providers are downloaded once into a shared plugin cache (TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR, default
# ~/.terraform.d/plugin-cache) and linked from there. Without it every run downloaded every provider
# of all three modules again - half a minute per commit, and one flaky download from GitHub failed
# the hook (found in the Chapter 05 lab, 2026-10-04).

# its owner. A lock is reclaimed only when that process no longer exists (a killed run); a live
# owner is waited for, up to 5 minutes. On exit a run removes the lock only if it is still its own.
