#!/usr/bin/env bash
# np-probe.sh - is a connection allowed? Answers the two questions separately: does the name
# resolve (DNS), and does a TCP connection to the port open?
#
# "nc ... && echo OPEN || echo BLOCKED" mixes them up: a name that does not resolve, a Service
# without endpoints and a NetworkPolicy all print BLOCKED. This probe prints both answers, so a
# blocked connection with working DNS points at the rules - and a failing DNS lookup does not.
#
# Usage: scripts/np-probe.sh -n <namespace> [-c <context>] [-l key=value]... <host> <port>
#   -n  the namespace the probe pod runs in (its NetworkPolicies apply to it)
#   -l  labels of the probe pod - the "identity" NetworkPolicies select (repeatable)
#   -c  the cluster: -c, else $KUBE_CONTEXT, else kind-sre-control-plane
# Example: scripts/np-probe.sh -n develop -l app=frontend backend 80
#
# Output, one line: "DNS ok (10.96.1.73), TCP open" | "DNS ok (...), TCP blocked" | "DNS FAILED".
# Exit code: 0 TCP open, 1 TCP blocked, 2 DNS failed, 3 usage error, 4 no verdict (the probe pod
# did not run - its output is printed).
# Runs a one-off pod through scripts/lab-pod.sh (Pod Security restricted, deleted afterwards).
# Changes nothing else. Needs kubectl and jq (for lab-pod.sh). Chapter 06.
