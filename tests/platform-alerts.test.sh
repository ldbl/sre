# Unit test for the platform alerts (flux/infrastructure/observability/kube-prometheus-stack/
# monitoring/platform-alerts.yaml) and the canary alerts of Chapter 19
# (flux/infrastructure/progressive-delivery/develop/alerts.yaml): promtool evaluates the rules against made-up series in
# tests/platform-alerts/tests.yaml and fails when an alert fires where it should not, or stays
# silent where it should fire - the restart loop that exits 0, the component that keeps a core busy.
#
# Runs in pre-commit and CI; no cluster, no network. Needs promtool (make check-tools) and yq (v4).
# A PrometheusRule is a Kubernetes object; promtool wants plain rules files, so each spec is
# extracted into a temporary directory first.
