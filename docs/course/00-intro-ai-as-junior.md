# Intro: AI as a Very Well-Read Junior Engineer

The course is not “how to use AI” and not “how to write prompts”.

It is about using AI in DevOps / SysOps / SRE **without increasing risk or blast radius**.

## The Mental Model

AI is the most well-read junior engineer you will ever work with:

- Knows tooling, flags, YAML, Terraform, Helm.
- Works fast and in parallel.
- Sounds confident.

And that is exactly why it is dangerous:

- It has low context.
- It has no production scar tissue.
- It does not feel risk.
- It does not care if it is prod or dev.

## The Rule

AI does not decide. AI proposes. Humans own decisions and accountability.

The system must be designed so that even a brave junior (or a tired on-call engineer) cannot break production by default.

## How Every Lesson Works

1. What would AI propose (the brave junior)?
2. What should we not allow?
3. What guardrail stops it?
4. What is the safe workflow?
